# Trilateral
Minecraft, except triangular

Trilateral is basically a Minecraft clo-- parody, where the boring cubes are replaced with triangular prisms.<br>
instead of the squares for top faces, they are triangles.

I watched a video (forgot exactly what, probably a cursed PhoenixSC video about hexagonal minecraft), <br>
and one of the comments talked about someone maybe actually making of that. <br>
I was already considering making my own game, and this seemed like a good way to start.<br>
After much thought, I decided that hexagons are not the bestagons in this case, so instead I opted for triangles.

This is the C# rewrite I've mentioned several times. <br>
Not only is the Java codebase an absolute mess, but C# is a better language to use for this project.
Also it has since been renamed to Trilateral, it used to be called Voxelesque.

some short term goals I should achieve before I can call this a "complete game":<br>
- save games<br>
- gameplay loop<br>
- basic biomes <br>
- flora and fauna <br>
