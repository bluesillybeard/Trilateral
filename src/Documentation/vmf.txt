VMF files are literally just a yaml file.

Any path referenced by a vmf file is relative to the folder that contains the file.

For example, if a file path is "vmf/test.vmf", then any path it references will be appended to "vmf/".
So, if test.vmf has the texture path of "../texture/test.png" then the real path is "vmf/../texture/test.png", or "texture/test.png"

here is an example (StoneBlock.vmf):
"""
type: entity
vertices: ../mesh/StoneBlock.vvertices
indices: ../mesh/StoneBlock.vindices
texture: ../texture/Stone.vqoi
"""

.vvertices files are just a dump of the vertices to be sent to OpenGL, compressed with gzip

.vindices file is similar to vvertices, except it's the indices for OpenGL.

a .qoi image is, well, an image compressed using the QOI format. look it up, it's actually pretty neat.
.vqoi is a modified version of qoi to fix a couple of issues.
qoi was designed to be as simple as possible, but with some modifications it can be much better.
They weren't implemented into the final qoi standard since they made it significantly more complicated.
The reason I am using QOI is because it's a freaking crap ton faster, and it has comperable compression to png.

Block models will come later.
